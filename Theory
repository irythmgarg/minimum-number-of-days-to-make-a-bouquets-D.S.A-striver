Problem Context
The function minDays is solving a problem related to flower arrangements, where:

We are given an array bloomDay representing the day each flower will bloom.
We need to make m bouquets, and each bouquet must contain exactly o consecutive flowers.
The goal is to find the minimum number of days required to create m bouquets, or return -1 if it is not possible.
Code Explanation
Class and Function Definitions
Class Declaration:

The code is encapsulated in a class named Solution, which adheres to standard coding practices in competitive programming for solving problems.
Helper Function fu:

Purpose: Checks if it is possible to make buque (number of bouquets) using flowers that bloom within mid days.
Parameters:
mid: The current day being evaluated.
piles: The bloomDay array.
buque: Number of bouquets required (m).
flrequired: Flowers required in each bouquet (o).
Logic:
Iterate through the bloomDay array.
Count consecutive flowers that can bloom on or before mid days.
If the count of consecutive flowers reaches flrequired, one bouquet is formed, and flowers counter resets to 0.
Stop once the required number of bouquets is formed, and return 1 (possible). If the loop completes without forming buque bouquets, return 0 (not possible).
Main Function minDays:

Purpose: Determines the minimum days needed to form m bouquets with o flowers each, using binary search.
Parameters:
bloomDay: Array of days when flowers bloom.
m: Number of bouquets required.
o: Number of flowers required in each bouquet.
Logic:
Use binary search to minimize the number of days required.
Initialize s (start) to the minimum bloom day and e (end) to the maximum bloom day in the array.
For each mid (midpoint of the current range):
Call the helper function fu to check if m bouquets can be formed in mid days.
If fu returns 1, adjust the search range to the left (e = mid - 1) to explore smaller days.
Otherwise, adjust the search range to the right (s = mid + 1) to explore larger days.
Return the value of s if it's within bounds; otherwise, return -1 if not possible.


Binary Search:

Used to efficiently find the minimum number of days.
Time complexity: 
O(Nâ‹…log(D)), where 
N is the size of the bloomDay array, and 
D is the range of bloom days.
Greedy Check:

The helper function fu greedily checks if m bouquets can be formed within mid days.
Edge Case:

If the total number of required flowers (m * o) exceeds the total number of flowers in bloomDay, it is impossible to form the bouquets. This case can be pre-checked:
